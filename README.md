# Express Reference
This repository is _not_ meant to be student-facing. It is the source materials for multiple express-related assignments for Unit 2.

Some patterns are here: [https://github.com/DayOnePl/dos-server](https://github.com/DayOnePl/dos-server) that we can use

## Usage

For Unit 2, because we build up slowly from (Node --> Node + Express + jsonfile + GET --> Node + Express + jsonfile + GET + POST...) etc., we have several separate student-facing repositories set up as assignments.

Every assignment has a corresponding basic solution stored as a BRANCH in this repo. eg. `master` branch corresponds to the repo  `pokedex-express`, `post` branch corresponds to the repo `pokedex-express-post`.
